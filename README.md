Cournot vs Bertrand Model for Varying Price and Quantities made During Semester 7 Game Theory for Data Science Mini Project

INTRODUCTION - 
Oligopolistic markets, in which a few firms dominate the supply of goods or services, are a fundamental area of study in industrial organization and game theory. Unlike perfectly competitive markets, firms in oligopolies must consider the strategic interactions of their competitors when making decisions about pricing and production. These interactions often determine market outcomes, including prices, quantities, and profitability. Two classical models—Cournot and Bertrand—capture the core aspects of competition in such markets and provide complementary perspectives on strategic behavior. In the Cournot model, firms compete by simultaneously selecting output quantities, and the market price adjusts according to total supply. Each firm’s optimal production depends on the anticipated output of its rival, leading to a Nash equilibrium where no firm can increase profit by changing its quantity unilaterally. Conversely, in the Bertrand model, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers purchase from the firm offering the lowest price. When firms have identical costs, Bertrand competition often drives prices down to marginal cost, reducing economic profits—a phenomenon known as the Bertrand paradox.
The Market Competition Simulator developed in this project provides an interactive platform for exploring these classical models through computational simulation. Built with Streamlit, the tool allows users to manipulate key market parameters, including demand intercept, demand slope, and firm-specific marginal costs, and observe the resulting equilibrium outcomes. It integrates reaction function plots, best-response dynamics, and profit visualizations to illustrate both static equilibria and the iterative adjustment process leading to equilibrium. By offering multiple graphing options and dynamic animation of strategy adjustments, the simulator provides a hands-on, intuitive understanding of strategic decision-making, equilibrium formation, and comparative outcomes under Cournot and Bertrand competition. This interactive approach bridges theoretical economic concepts and computational modelling, making the analysis of oligopolistic market behaviour accessible, visual, and educational
